# EuroTrip-2015
We'll be in Europe for most of May. This repo is used to organize our travel plans. 

## Call for Help

So basically, we ([my wife](https://twitter.com/ashleykrista) and I) are going to be flying into Berlin on April 28th, and leaving May 20th/21st. For most of the time in between, we want to just kind of hang out around Germany(ish) and meet awesome people. 

Do you have a couch? Or a carpeted floor? A manger, maybe? We're not picky. We'd love to hop on a train and come visit for a few days. If you're interested, open an issue or a pull request on this repo so we can coordinate stuff :tada:
